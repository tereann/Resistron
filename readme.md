***Description***  
This is a program that calculates the resistance of a 4-band resistor.  
IntelliJ IDEA and SceneBuilder were used.
 
***Objectives:***  
* To create an interactive program using JavaFX.
* To allow users choose the color for each band.
* To automatically calculate the value based on the colors chosen.
* To display the result in an uneditable text field and the unit label next ot it in Ohms.
* To display tolerance percentage in an uneditable text field.
* To calculate the value each time the color chosen is changed.
* To be color-blind friendly.
